AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures: 
The "AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures" is an innovative project employing machine learning to enable users to control their computer mouse through hand gestures. Leveraging computer vision techniques, the application interprets hand movements and translates them into mouse actions. Deep learning models accurately predict gestures, providing an intuitive interface for seamless computer interaction.

Project Highlights: 
Computer Vision Magic: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for robust image processing, hand tracking, and gesture recognition.

Mouse Control: Autopy library empowers precise control of mouse movements and clicks.

Accessible Everywhere: Designed to run on any computer with a camera, democratizing the experience of computer vision and machine learning.

Open-Source Collaboration: Find the project's code on GitHub, welcoming contributions from the community.

Dependencies: 
Ensure the installation of the following dependencies:

OpenCV: For image processing and drawing.
MediaPipe: Facilitates hand tracking.
Autopy: Empowers mouse movement and click control.
